## Data and analysis of Agent-Based Model of Warfare-Induced Residence Change

This is supplementary information for [*Warfare induces post-marital residence change* (Moravec et al. 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.05.002)

### Content

This repository contains 4 separate runs with different parameters (see *description_of_runs.txt*).

While makefile is provided, unfortunatelly github does not provide enough space to upload the source data for each analysis. However, makefile can still be used to explore how data were analysed.

Of interest are thus only following folders:

* **merged** -- parameter values and calculated statistics in explored time-points
* **graphs2d** -- two dimensional plots of statistics and parameter values in particular time-point
* **stats** -- time-series of chosen statistics
